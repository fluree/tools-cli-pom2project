# tools-cli-pom2project

Generates a project.clj file from an existing pom.xml file

## Installation

Download from https://github.com/com.fluree/tools-cli-pom2project

## Usage

Add this as a dependency in a deps.edn alias like so:

```clojure
:project.clj
{:replace-deps {com.fluree/tools-cli-pom2project {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}
 :main-opts ["-m" "fluree.tools-cli-pom2project"]
 ;; some example injections; you don't need to copy these
 :pom2project/injections 
 {:test-paths ["test"]
  :plugins [[jonase/eastwood "0.3.6"]
            [lein-kibit "0.1.8"]
            [lein-ancient "0.6.15"]
            [lein-cloverage "1.1.2"]
            [lein-nvd "1.4.0"]]}}}}
```

Make sure you have a valid pom.xml file for your project (e.g. `clojure -Spom`)
and then run the alias you created above like this: `clojure -M:project.clj`.

Run the project's tests (not working yet):

    $ clojure -M:test:runner

Build a jar:

    $ clojure -X:jar

## Options

You can put anything you'd like added to the generated `project.clj` file in
the `:pom2project/injections` map (see Usage section above for an example).
